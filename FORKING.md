```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Edit `src/character.ts` to define your agent's personality. See detailed instructions below.

### Step 5: Run Your Agent

npm start    # Production mode
```

## Detailed Customization Guide

### 1. Environment Configuration (.env)

#### Required Changes:
```env
# Generate new UUID at https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
AGENT_ID=your-new-uuid-here
AGENT_NAME=YourAgentName

```

```

### 2. Character Definition (src/character.ts)

Your agent's personality is defined in `src/character.ts`. Here's what to customize:

#### Basic Identity:
```typescript
export const character: Character = {
  name: "YourAgentName",  // Change this
  id: "your-uuid-here",    // Use the UUID from .env
```

#### System Prompt (Trading Philosophy):
```typescript
system: "You are [AgentName], a [description of trading style]. You [key behaviors]. You focus on [market types]. You believe [core philosophy]."
```

#### Example System Prompts:

**Conservative Value Investor:**
```typescript
system: "You are Alice, a conservative value investor focusing on long-term political and economic markets. You only trade when you have high confidence based on fundamental analysis. You believe in patient, research-driven decisions and never chase trends."
```

**Aggressive Day Trader:**
```typescript
system: "You are Bob, an aggressive day trader specializing in sports and short-term event markets. You make quick decisions based on momentum and sentiment. You're comfortable with higher risk for higher rewards."
```

**News-Driven Trader:**
```typescript
system: "You are Dave, a news-driven trader who reacts quickly to breaking news. You scan multiple sources for market-moving information and trade on sentiment shifts before the crowd catches on."
```

#### Bio (Background & Personality):
```typescript
bio: [
  "Your agent's background",
  "Trading philosophy",
  "Special expertise areas",
  "Risk tolerance",
  "Personality traits",
  "Current focus areas"
]
```

#### Topics (Areas of Expertise):
```typescript
topics: [
  "prediction markets",  // Keep this
  "your specialty area",
  "specific market types",
  "relevant domains"
]
```

#### Message Examples:
Customize the conversation examples to match your agent's personality and speaking style.

### 3. Package.json Updates

Update metadata for your agent:
```json
{
  "name": "your-agent-name",
  "description": "Your agent's description",
  "repository": {
    "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO"
  },
  "author": "Your Name"
}
```

### 4. Telegram Bot Setup (Optional)

If you want your agent to have its own Telegram bot:

1. Create bot with BotFather:
```
/newbot
Name: Your Agent Name
Username: youragent_bot
```

2. Add to .env:
```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=@youragent_bot
```

3. Customize bot commands in BotFather

### 5. Custom Trading Strategies

#### Option A: Configuration-Based
Adjust parameters in `.env` for different strategies without code changes.

#### Option B: Code-Based
Create custom logic in `src/strategies/`:
```typescript
// src/strategies/myStrategy.ts
export class MyCustomStrategy {
  async evaluateMarket(market: Market): Promise<TradeSignal> {
    // Your custom logic
  }
}
```

### 6. Branding & UI Customization

#### Web Dashboard (optional):
- Update `web/components/Header.tsx` with your agent name
- Customize colors in `web/tailwind.config.js`
- Replace logos in `images/` folder

#### Social Media:
- Update Twitter/Discord usernames in `.env`
- Customize announcement templates

```typescript
name: "SportsBetty",
system: "You are SportsBetty, a sports betting specialist focusing on NFL, NBA, and Premier League markets...",
bio: ["Former sports analyst", "Statistical modeling expert", ...],

```

### Example 2: Political Markets Expert
