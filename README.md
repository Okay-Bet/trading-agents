- **Actions**: Market analysis, price checking, and trading operations
- **Providers**: Real-time data feeds and market information
- **Services**: Background services for monitoring and analysis
- **Types**: TypeScript definitions for market data and trading operations

## Development Status

**Current Status**: Initial setup complete with basic framework integration.

**Working Features**:
- âœ… Project structure and build system
- âœ… Character configuration for prediction market focus
- âœ… Plugin architecture foundation
- âœ… Environment configuration
- âœ… TypeScript compilation

**Next Steps**:
1. Integrate working polymarket actions
2. Add real-time market data feeds
3. Implement trading strategies

5. Deploy and monitor

## Plugin Compatibility

The polymarket plugin from the ElizaOS addpolygon branch required several compatibility fixes:
- Action handler return type updates (Content â†’ ActionResult)
- WebSocket type definitions
- State management improvements
- Plugin initialization compatibility

See `PLUGIN_COMPATIBILITY_NOTES.md` for detailed information about the fixes applied.
