- Agent startup and initialization
- Polymarket plugin loading
- CLOB client connection

### ðŸ”„ Next Testing Steps
1. Access web UI and test conversation flow
2. Verify natural language â†’ action conversion

4. Confirm error handling and edge cases
5. Validate complete workflow end-to-end

## Key Features to Validate

### Action Discovery
- Agent should recognize trading requests in natural language

- Sell order execution with profit/loss calculation

### Error Handling
- Invalid requests handled gracefully

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise during testing:

1. **Check logs** in the console for detailed error messages
2. **Verify credentials** - wallet private key and API access
3. **Check market availability** - some markets may be closed
4. **Validate order parameters** - minimum sizes, price ranges
5. **Monitor gas and balance** - ensure sufficient USDC for trading

## Expected Agent Behavior

Pamela should:
- Be conversational and explain her trading decisions
- Show market analysis and reasoning
