## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Add integration tests for API interactions
- Include E2E tests for complete trading workflows
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(trading): add sell position functionality
fix(api): handle CLOB client timeout errors
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(orders): add limit order placement tests
```

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Trading Safety
- Never commit private keys or sensitive credentials
- Always validate user inputs and API parameters
- Implement proper rate limiting for API calls
- Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases

### Code Security
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Validate and sanitize all external inputs
- Follow secure coding practices
- Report security issues privately (see SECURITY.md)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test:component
```
Test individual functions and components in isolation.

### Integration Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
Test complete workflows with real ElizaOS runtime and database.

### Manual Testing
- Test with small amounts ($1-5) on live markets
- Verify error handling with invalid inputs
- Test autonomous trading for extended periods

## üìù Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Code Quality**
   - Run `npm run lint` and fix any issues
   - Run `npm run type-check` and resolve TypeScript errors
   - Run `npm test` and ensure all tests pass

2. **Documentation**
   - Update README.md if adding new features
   - Add JSDoc comments for new public APIs
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes

3. **Testing**
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Test manually with small trading amounts
   - Verify backwards compatibility

### PR Guidelines
- **Title**: Use clear, descriptive titles
- **Description**: Explain what changes were made and why
- **Testing**: Describe how you tested the changes
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearly document any breaking changes
