### 4. MISSING ERROR PATH TESTING
Critical error scenarios not covered:

- Network failures (API timeouts, connection errors)
- API errors (400/500 responses, rate limiting)
- Invalid parameters (malformed data, wrong types)
- Insufficient balance scenarios
- Authentication failures (expired tokens, invalid keys)
- Order rejection handling (market closed, invalid prices)
- Blockchain errors (gas failures, transaction reverts)
- Data parsing errors (malformed responses)

### 5. MISSING EDGE CASE TESTING
Important boundary conditions not tested:

- Empty market responses
- Zero balances and positions
- Maximum order sizes and limits
- Price boundary conditions (0, negative, extremely high)
- Token ID validation (invalid formats, non-existent tokens)
- Wallet connection failures
- Concurrent operation handling
- Rate limiting scenarios

3. **Order management**
   - Order cancellation workflows
   - Active order monitoring
   - Order status tracking

4. **Market data retrieval**
   - Market listing and filtering

   - Environment setup

## ESTIMATED IMPLEMENTATION EFFORT

### Test Files Needed:
- **6-8 action test files** for untested actions
- **3-4 error scenario test files** for comprehensive error handling
- **2-3 utility/service test files** for infrastructure coverage
- **2-3 integration test files** for end-to-end workflows

**Total: ~12-15 additional test files**

### Development Time Estimate:
- High Priority: 2-3 days (core trading coverage)
- Medium Priority: 1-2 days (management features)
- Low Priority: 1-2 days (infrastructure/utilities)

**Total: 4-7 days for comprehensive coverage**

### Coverage Targets:
- Current: ~28% line coverage
- High Priority Complete: ~60% coverage
- Medium Priority Complete: ~75% coverage  
- Full Implementation: ~90-95% coverage

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate (High ROI):**
   - Add error handling tests to existing actions
   - Test sell order functionality
   - Add order cancellation tests

2. **Short-term (Complete Core):**
   - Test market data retrieval actions
   - Add API key management tests
   - Test WebSocket functionality

3. **Long-term (Full Coverage):**
   - Service layer comprehensive testing
   - Utility function coverage
   - Edge case and boundary testing

## NOTES

- Current live integration approach is excellent for production confidence
- Focus on error paths will provide highest coverage gains
- Many utilities can be tested with unit tests (faster execution)
- Consider mock testing for some service layer components to avoid API limits
- Prioritize based on business-critical functionality first
