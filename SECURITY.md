#### Private Key Security
- Private keys are stored in environment variables only
- Never commit private keys to version control
- Use secure key management systems in production
- Consider hardware security modules (HSMs) for high-value deployments

#### Trading Safeguards
- Position size limits prevent excessive trades
- Balance verification before order execution
- Market validation to ensure legitimate trading pairs
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse

#### Smart Contract Interactions
- All Polymarket interactions go through audited CLOB contracts
- Slippage protection on market orders
- Gas estimation and fee management
- Transaction monitoring and failure handling

### Infrastructure Security

#### Environment Configuration
- Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- Network security for production deployments  
- Database encryption for sensitive trading data
- Audit logging for all trading activities

#### Access Control
