# Pamela Autonomous Trading Agent - SIMPLIFIED TODO

## üéØ APPROACH CHANGE: Using ElizaOS Simple Character Method

After analysis, we're switching from complex TypeScript project to ElizaOS's intended simple approach.

**Why?** The ElizaOS team already built everything we need. The `@elizaos/plugin-polymarket` package has:
- ‚úÖ All trading actions (buy, sell, cancel, redeem)
- ‚úÖ Market analysis tools
- ‚úÖ Portfolio management
- ‚úÖ Risk management
- ‚úÖ Real-time data feeds
- ‚úÖ Web interface
- ‚úÖ Production-ready deployment

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE TASKS (15 minutes total)

### Phase 1: Get Basic Agent Running (5 minutes)
- [x] Create `pamela.json` character file
- [x] Create `.env.simple` environment template
- [x] Create `SIMPLE_SETUP.md` instructions
- [ ] Install ElizaOS CLI: `npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta`
- [ ] Set up environment variables in `.env`
- [ ] Test locally: `elizaos start --character pamela.json`

### Phase 2: Deploy to Railway (5 minutes)
- [ ] Install Railway CLI: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
- [ ] Deploy: `railway init && railway up`
- [ ] Add environment variables in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Test production deployment

### Phase 3: Fund and Test Trading (5 minutes)

## üìà ENHANCEMENT PHASES (Optional)

### Phase 4: Add Intelligence Plugins (Optional)
**If we want more features, just add plugins to pamela.json:**
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-polymarket",  // Trading (already included)
    "@elizaos/plugin-news",        // News monitoring
    "@elizaos/plugin-twitter",     // Social sentiment
    "@elizaos/plugin-web-search",  // Market research
    "@elizaos/plugin-telegram"     // Notifications

}
```
